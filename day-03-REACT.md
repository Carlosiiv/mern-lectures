## What is React?

React is a declarative JS library for building UIs.<br>
It's declarative because you have to tell it what to do, instead of it having it's own opinions about how to do things.<br>
<br>
React uses objects called `Componenets` to peice together our webpage, and we can build these components in a couple different ways.<br>

#### Initial Setup

To setup an initial React project type `npx create-react-app app-name`.

*MUST CALL YOUR PROJECT NAME LIKE SO `app-name`*
